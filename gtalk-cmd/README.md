# Command line based GTalk client #
This is a command line based GTalk client written in Ruby. For now the functionality is very basic. You can login and chat to whoever sends you a message.
Over time, I will add more to it.

# How to run? #
Clone the directory. Then run *bundle install*. Then type *ruby gtalkBot.rb*. Thats it!
